"""
Building non-blocking, asynchronous TCP server that handles multiple client connections simultaneously, 
with a focus on understanding selectors and how Linux's epoll system improves performance.

1) Non-blocking I/O:
    -> Non-blocking sockets allow the application to continue doing useful work (or serve other clients) while waiting for data or connections.
    -> Set the Socket's File Descriptor blocking flag to False to make it non-blocking.'

2) How Selectors (Application Level) / Epoll (Kernel Level) Work:
    -> Register a socket (file descriptor) with the selector and specify which events youâ€™re interested in (e.g., EVENT_READ for incoming data, EVENT_WRITE for sending).
    -> Use the select() method in a loop to check which sockets are ready for the specified events.
    for the server listening socket, we listen for EVENT_READ to accept new connections. For client sockets, we also monitor EVENT_READ to check if there's incoming data to be processed.

3) Asyncio Non Blocking Operations:
    -> asyncio.get_event_loop().sock_recv(sock, 1024) instead of sock.recv(1024)
    -> asyncio.get_event_loop().sock_sendall(sock, data) instead of sock.sendall(data)
